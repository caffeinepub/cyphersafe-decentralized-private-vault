  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested features for desktop optimization, including responsive layout, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+S, Esc), desktop install prompt with golden styling, and cross-device sync infrastructure. However, evidence for REQ-1's inline editor requirement is ambiguous in the truncated diff, and backend verification for REQ-6 is difficult to assess from the truncated backend code.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Right column shows the FullScreenEditorOverlay component embedded inline (not as an overlay)",
      "reason": "The truncated NotesApp.tsx diff shows responsive layout logic and mentions isInlineMode, but the implementation details confirming inline embedding on desktop (>1024px) versus overlay mode on mobile are not fully visible in the truncated code. The acceptance criteria requires the editor to be embedded inline on desktop, not as an overlay.",

# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Optimize CypherSafe for desktop users with a responsive side-by-side layout, keyboard shortcuts for productivity, and a desktop installation prompt.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement side-by-side layout on screens wider than 1024px (notes list on left, editor on right)
- Add keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+N (new note), Ctrl+S (save), Esc (exit editor)
- Display golden notification prompting desktop users to install CypherSafe
- Verify cross-device note synchronization using Internet Identity

**User-visible outcome:** Desktop users can view notes and edit simultaneously in a two-column layout, use keyboard shortcuts for faster note management, receive an install prompt for PWA installation, and access their notes seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices with the same login.
